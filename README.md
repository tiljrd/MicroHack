Software:

- Android App "MicroDoor" which displays the status of the door (repository includes only MainActivity and main layout file);
- databaseDoor.py on the raspberry pi which sends data to google firestore and reads from the arduino serial output
- keypad.ino on the Arduino to process the keypad input and send appropriate data to the Raspberry Pi
